Planety: Friendship Management App
Bringing friends closer, one meaningful connection at a time.
Problem Planety Solves
In todayâ€™s world, people struggle to maintain friendships after major life transitions such as graduating, moving, or becoming busier with work. Many friendships fade not because of lack of care, but due to lack of effort and organization. Traditional social media does not help strengthen relationshipsâ€”it often promotes superficial connections rather than meaningful ones.
How Planety Solves It
Planety provides a structured yet fun way to track, nurture, and engage with friendships. It helps users organize their social circles, remember important moments, and maintain a balance between different types of friendships through gamification and reminders. By categorizing friendships and encouraging intentional interactions, Planety ensures users donâ€™t lose touch with people who matter.
Core Features
1. Friendship Categorization & Tracking
Users take a fun quiz when adding a friend to determine their â€˜friend planetâ€™ (e.g., best friend = Earth, casual friend = Saturn, long-distance friend = Neptune, etc.).
Friendship categories help users visualize and understand their relationships better.
Users can manually adjust a friend's category at any time.
2. Meaningful Interaction Reminders
AI-driven or manual reminders prompt users to check in with friends based on their interaction patterns.
Gentle nudges encourage thoughtful interactions without overwhelming users.
3. Memory & Event Tracking
Users can log memories, events, and milestones in friendships.
Provides a visual timeline of shared experiences, making it easy to reminisce and stay engaged.

All your social life in one place.
